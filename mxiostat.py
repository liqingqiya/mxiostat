# A version of iostat that actually reports real numbers taken straight
# from the kernel. This uses the 2.6 /proc/diskstats stuff.
#
# Usage: mxiostat.py [-qvaiH] [-D DEV,...] [-c COUNT] [[DEV|FIELD,...] [DELAY]]
#
# -q: don't print the periodic header.
# -v: be more verbose in some situations.
# -c COUNT: exit after printing COUNT reports.
# -a: report on particular stat(s) for all disks, instead of all stats for
#	one disk
# -C: compact reporting for multiple fields in -a mode; all fields for all
#     disks are printed on one line.
# -V: 'vertical' report for multiple disks in -a mode, where each disk is
#     printed on one line
# -z: do not print stats for disks where all the stats are zero. Only works
#     in -aV.
# -D DEV,...: in -a, report on only these device(s) instead of all devices
# -X DEV,...: in -a, exclude these devices from the report
#
# DEV is the device to report stats on; it defaults to 'sda'.
# FIELD,... is the field or fields to report on for all disks; it defaults
#	to 'util'. 'all' may be used for all fields, and it is the default
#	for -V.
# DELAY is the amount of time to delay between report lines, in
# seconds; it defaults to one (1) second. You can use fractional
# seconds if you want to.
#
# -a has three display modes: fields down the side and disks horizontally
# (the default), disks down the side and fields horizontally (-V), and a
# compact form where everything is printed on one line (-C).
#
# All statistics are per-second ones, regardless of the delay, except for
# 'act' which is an instantaneous number (how many IOs are in flight RIGHT
# NOW, as the program reads the data).
# 'rwait', 'wwait', and 'await' are in milliseconds. 'util' is a percentage.
# 'rsect' and 'wsect' are 512-byte units. (We could print rkB and wkB, but
# the author wants this to be as close to raw as possible.)
#
# See the end of the code for more information on fields.

# This avoids all sorts of irritating 'float(...)/...' usage and lets
# us just divide straight.
