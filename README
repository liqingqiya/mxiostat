== What it is:

This is a Linux program that reports accurate and trustworthy disk IO
stats on a Linux 2.6/3.x machine without either making stats up or lying
to you when counter rollover happens. The numbers are taken directly
from the kernel statistics.

Information on iostat's problems:

Information on what IO stats you get from the kernel and what they
mean:
	http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/DiskIOStats

(this information is slightly out of date; in modern 2.6 kernels you can
get full stats on a per-partition basis, and mxiostat supports this.)

See mxiostat.1 for a manpage.

=== Bugs:

- manpage could stand improvement.
- contains vestigial code that should be removed or in some cases
  reformed.
- usage is confusing and complex.

=== Copyright:

GPL v3 for now.
